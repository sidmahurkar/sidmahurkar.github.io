Unlike English, Indic languages have a rich morphosyntax, grammatical genders, free linear word-order, and a highly inflectional morphology. In this paper, we introduce VyƒÅkarana: a benchmark dataset of Colorless Green sentences in Indic languages for syntactic testing of multilingual language models. We use the dataset to probe four multilingual language models: mBERT, DistilmBERT, XLM-R, and IndicBERT for syntax in Indic languages. In our experiments, we report the results of layer-wise probing for four syntax-related tasks: PoS Tagging, Syntax Tree-depth Prediction, Grammatical Case Marking, and Subject-Verb Agreement. Our results show that the language models trained with Indic languages exclusively do not capture syntax as efficiently as the other highly multilingual language models.\n","tags":["Indic_NLP","Syntax"],"title":"VyƒÅkarana: A Colorless Green Benchmark for Syntactic Evaluation in Indic Languages","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Siddhant Mahurkar","Rajaswa Patil"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1607859623,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607859623,"objectID":"dd2df3d9fa2d533ed82c83c321c021d4","permalink":"https://sidmahurkar.github.io/publication/lrg-at-semeval-2020-task-7/","publishdate":"2021-02-13T17:10:23+05:30","relpermalink":"/publication/lrg-at-semeval-2020-task-7/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we assess the ability of BERT and its derivative models (RoBERTa, DistilBERT, and ALBERT) for short-edits based humor grading.

Further, we also inspect the role of self-attention layers in humor-grading by performing a qualitative analysis over the self-attention weights from the final layer of the trained BERT model.

In this paper, we propose and assess the ability of two approaches for the task of multi-modal fake news detection. For the first approach, we fuse the textual and image modalities. The textual features are obtained from the pre-trained language models such as BERT and SBERT and image features are extracted from ResNet-18 pre-trained on ImageNet dataset. In the second approach, we use Visual Attention for fake news detection. We test both the strategies on Gossipcop and Politifact dataset. Our experiments show that the complete text of the article and the BERT model setting provides the best result. Further, we use Integrated gradients to analyze our models by observing input attributions.","tags":["NLP","Fake News Detection","Multi-Modal Models"],"title":"Attributional Analysis of Multi‚ÄëModal Fake News Detection Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rajaswa Patil","Siddhant Mahurkar"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1576265560,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1576265560,"objectID":"6230eda97353bcd70d5e43f5cd8eb290","permalink":"https://sidmahurkar.github.io/publication/citta/","publishdate":"2021-02-14T01:02:40+05:30","relpermalink":"/publication/citta/","section":"publication","summary":"Most of the recommendation and search frameworks in Digital Libraries follow a keyword-based approach to resolve text-based search queries. Keyword-based methods usually fail to capture the semantic aspects of the user‚Äôs query and often lead to a misleading set of results. In this work, we propose an efficient and content-sentiment aware semantic recommendation framework, Citta. The framework is designed with the BERT language model. It is designed to retrieve semantically related reading recommendations with short input queries and shorter response times.
